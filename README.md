## A. North Star Metrics & Key Dimensions

### 🔹 **North Star Metrics**
1. **Total Sales (EUR)** – Primary revenue driver
2. **Total Profit (EUR)** – Core profitability indicator
3. **Orders Returned (%)** – Quality & satisfaction proxy
4. **Customer Segment Sales Distribution** – Market composition
5. **City-wise Sales & Profits** – Regional performance breakdown

### 🔹 **Key Dimensions Analyzed**
1. **City**: Kraków, Łódź, Warsaw, Wrocław
2. **Customer Segment**: Corporate, Home Office, Small Business, Consumer
3. **Product Category & Sub-Category**
4. **Order Date, Weekday**
5. **Order Status (Returned / Completed)**


## B. Summary of Key Insights

1. **Regional Performance**
   - **Łódź** generated the highest total profit (€85,291) followed by **Kraków** (€77,365) and **Warsaw** (€75,845).
   - **Wrocław** reported a **net loss of €14,424**, indicating potential inefficiencies in sales or returns in that city.
   - City-wise weekday order heatmap shows that **Thursday and Saturday** are the busiest days across cities, especially in **Kraków** and **Warsaw**. This presents ideal timing for promotions.

2. **Customer Segment Distribution**
   - **Office Supplies** dominate across all segments, with **Corporate** and **Consumer** segments contributing the most.
   - **Furniture** and **Technology** sales are notably driven by the **Home Office** and **Small Business** segments—suggesting a remote/work-from-home clientele.

3. **Product and Category Performance**
   - Top-selling sub-categories by revenue include **Paper, Chairs, Phones, and Office Machines**.
   - **Profit contribution**, however, is skewed. Some frequently sold items like **Telephones** show relatively low profit margins.
   - **Horizontal bar chart** clearly highlights products contributing most to **overall profitability**—a mix of furniture and office tech.

4. **Returns & Profitability**
   - Out of 1365 orders, only 11 were returned, resulting in a return rate of just 0.81% — a strong operational indicator.
   - Total Sales: €1,924,338
     Total Profit: €224,078
     These indicate an overall ~11.6% profit margin, which is moderate and leaves room for optimization through pricing or cost control.

5. **Time Trends**
- The **Sales-Profit timeline** line chart shows steady growth with a **mid-period surge**, possibly aligning with a seasonal or campaign period.
- **Product-wise profit distribution** suggests a skew toward a few high-margin products. Increasing volume in these could significantly boost profits.


## C. Recommendations & Next Steps

1. **Focus on High-Performing Cities**:
   - Invest more in **Łódź** and **Kraków**, the two most profitable cities, through targeted digital ads or local partnerships.
   - Audit operations in **Wrocław**, especially around logistics, pricing, or regional demand, to understand the source of loss.

2. **Product & Category Strategy**:
   - Double down on top-performing sub-categories like **Chairs and Phones** through bundles or cross-sell strategies.
   - Investigate low-margin high-sales products—consider revising pricing or negotiating supplier contracts.

3. **Customer Segmentation Tactics**:
   - Tailor campaigns for the **Home Office segment**, particularly in Furniture—possibly targeting WFH upgrades.
   - Offer technology bundles for **Corporate clients** based on existing sales trends.

4. **Sales Timing Optimization**:
   - Leverage high-activity days (Thursdays, Saturdays) to send **email promos or discounts** early in the week.
   - Explore bundling offers for low-activity cities (like Wrocław) to raise order count.

5. **Return Rate Monitoring**:
   - Maintain current quality levels as the **return rate is already excellent**.
   - Watch for any spikes in returns from specific cities or categories in future months.
